# OS-Synchronization-Producer-Consumer-
The producer and the consumer are 2 separate programs each of them has its own file and can be executed on its own, i.e., the producer and the consumer can be run separately in two terminals. The Producer • If the buffer is full, it waits (blocks) for the consumer to consume an item. • Otherwise, it produces a new item and adds it to the buffer. The Consumer • If the buffer is empty, it waits (blocks) for the producer to produce an item. • Otherwise, it consumes an item from the buffer. Both • Each should print a message before they try to produce/consume an item. • Each should print a message after they have produced/consumed an item (this message should include the item). • The rate of production/consumption (items per second) for each should be passed to each one independently as a command-line argument and it should NOT be shared between them.
